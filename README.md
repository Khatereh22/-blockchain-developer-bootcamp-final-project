*Problem area*

The importance of information security in organizations cannot be overstated. Sensitive data is one of an organisation’s most important assets, so it makes sense that you prioritise its security. In Afghanistan becuase of security issues, nowadays most of organizations scann the hard files and destroy all the contracts and hard information because of the security problem. Most of staff work at home most of them miss the meeting, calls, programs because they do not have a good system to do the voting process.

•	Blockchain records data securely, admin can add personal information of staff to register them in the system, and share only what is required for a given transaction.
•	Admin can make a poll for voting, for example: making a poll for date of zoom call agreement, having staff wellbeing  program and any other events which need voting.
